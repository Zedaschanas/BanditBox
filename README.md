## Overview

In BanditBox, you will find detailed write-ups for various vulnerable machines. Each machine serves as a stepping stone to learn different concepts and techniques in offensive cybersecurity. Our goal is to simplify complex ideas and make them accessible to everyone. 

### Purpose

The primary aim of BanditBox is to gather and contextualize offensive cybersecurity concepts that are often hard to grasp. We do this through practical machine resolutions, allowing users to learn by doing. Each resolved machine adds another concept to our mental toolkit, expanding our knowledge in the vast world of cybersecurity.

## Concepts and Tools

In this section, we categorize various concepts and tools used in our exercises. Each entry provides a brief explanation to help you understand its relevance in the field of cybersecurity.

### Common Concepts

- **CTF (Capture The Flag)**: A type of cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to capture flags, which are usually hidden strings of text.
  
- **Exploit Development**: The process of creating a program or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability in software or hardware.

- **Privilege Escalation**: Techniques used to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from the user.

- **Reconnaissance**: The initial phase of penetration testing where the tester gathers information about the target system.

### Tools Used

- **Docker**: A platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers.
  
- **Obsidian**: A powerful note-taking app that helps in organizing knowledge and concepts.

- **Linux Security Tools**: Various tools available in Linux environments that assist in securing and testing systems.

## Exploitation Techniques

This section categorizes the techniques used in each machine resolution. We aim to provide clarity on how each technique works and its application in real-world scenarios.

### Categories of Exploitation

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: A security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into content from otherwise trusted websites.

- **SQL Injection**: A code injection technique that exploits a security vulnerability in an application's software by manipulating SQL queries.

- **Buffer Overflow**: A situation where a program writes more data to a block of memory, leading to unpredictable behavior.
